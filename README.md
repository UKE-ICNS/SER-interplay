# Interplay of positive and negative feedback loops determines attractors in a stylized model of excitable dynamics on graphs, SER model implementation.

This is a repository for the project to model the effects structural change in the network will have on the resulting network's attractor space under the susceptible-excited-refractory (SER) model. 

To analyse all the emerging attractors in the network under the SER dynamics using working and non-working triangles notation, use the "main.py" file. To go through the numerical examples, use the "numerical_examples.py" file. The files will use some functions from the "funcs.py". The SER model is in the "SER_interplay.py". Before that, install the "ser_interplay.yml" environment. 

All of the attractor data will be saved in the "Files/data" folder. All the structural templates needed to analyze structural matrices can be found un the "Files" folder.
